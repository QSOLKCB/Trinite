# QSOL-GEO-REASON Mathematical Specification

Status: **Phase 1 exact-mathematics contract**

This document freezes the mathematical semantics that the Phase 1 reference implementation approximates numerically. It is normative for the meaning of the Phase 1 geometry primitives, subject to the higher-level epistemic rules in `INVARIANTS.md` and `SCIENTIFIC-CONTRACT.md`.

The purpose of this separation is deliberate:

- this document specifies mathematics over exact real vector spaces;
- `src/qsol_geo_reason/` implements a finite-precision reference instrument;
- `GEO-SIM-001` tests implementation conformance on frozen synthetic cases;
- a future Lean 4 development should formalize this exact layer against an immutable release/tag;
- a Lean proof of this specification will **not** by itself prove the Python/IEEE-754 implementation correct.

## 1. Ambient space and trajectories

### GEO-MATH-001 — Finite Euclidean trajectory

Fix a dimension `d >= 1`. A trajectory is a non-empty finite ordered sequence

\[
Z = (z_0, z_1, \ldots, z_{n-1}), \qquad z_i \in \mathbb{R}^d,\ n \ge 1.
\]

All points in a trajectory have the same dimension.

The order of the sequence is part of the object. A trajectory is not identified with its set of points.

## 2. Finite differences

### GEO-MATH-002 — Forward finite difference

Define the order-zero finite difference by

\[
\Delta^0 Z = Z.
\]

For `k >= 0`, if

\[
\Delta^k Z = (x_0,\ldots,x_{m-1})
\]

with `m >= 2`, then

\[
\Delta^{k+1} Z
=
(x_1-x_0,\ x_2-x_1,\ldots,x_{m-1}-x_{m-2}).
\]

Therefore `Delta^k Z` contains `n-k` samples when `0 <= k < n`, and is empty for `k >= n`.

Terms such as *velocity* and *acceleration* are shorthand for finite-difference quantities only.

## 3. Path length

### GEO-MATH-003 — Piecewise-linear path length

For

\[
Z=(z_0,\ldots,z_{n-1}),
\]

define

\[
L(Z)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-2}\|z_{i+1}-z_i\|_2.
\]

For a one-point trajectory, `L(Z)=0`.

Consequences to preserve:

- `L(Z) >= 0`;
- `L(Z)=0` iff every consecutive displacement is zero;
- translations preserve path length;
- Euclidean isometries preserve path length;
- uniform scaling by scalar `s` multiplies path length by `|s|`.

## 4. Cosine alignment

### GEO-MATH-004 — Extended cosine convention

For nonzero vectors `u,v in R^d`,

\[
\operatorname{cos}(u,v)
=
\frac{\langle u,v\rangle}{\|u\|_2\|v\|_2}.
\]

QSOL-GEO-REASON extends the ordinary cosine with explicit exact-zero conventions:

\[
C(0,0)=1,
\qquad
C(0,v)=C(u,0)=0
\]

for nonzero `u` and `v`.

These conventions apply only to **exact** zero vectors. No absolute magnitude threshold may reclassify a nonzero vector as zero.

For two aligned trajectories whose order-`k` finite-difference sequences contain `m >= 1` samples, mean cosine alignment is

\[
A_k(X,Y)
=
\frac{1}{m}
\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}
C((\Delta^k X)_i,(\Delta^k Y)_i).
\]

If no finite-difference samples remain, the mean is **undefined**. It must not be encoded as `0`.

## 5. Alignment

### GEO-MATH-005 — Pair alignment policies

Three alignment policies are defined.

**`error`** requires equal sample counts and otherwise rejects the comparison.

**`truncate`** retains the common prefix of length `min(n_X,n_Y)`.

**`arclength`** treats each trajectory as a piecewise-linear curve. For a pair of trajectories with sample counts `n_X` and `n_Y`, define the common resampling count

\[
m=\max(n_X,n_Y).
\]

Both trajectories are resampled to exactly `m` samples before finite differencing or comparison. If `m = 1`, the sole sample is the original point. If `m >= 2`, the samples occur at normalized arc-length fractions

\[
\frac{j}{m-1}, \qquad j=0,\ldots,m-1.
\]

For nonzero-length paths, arc-length resampling must preserve the exact first and last geometric endpoints.

For exactly zero-length paths, every resampled point is the common geometric location.

Small but nonzero segments are not mathematically discardable merely because other segments are much larger.

The count rule above is part of the exact pair-alignment contract and must be used by the future Lean formalization unless a later release explicitly changes `GEO-MATH-005`.

## 6. Menger curvature

### GEO-MATH-006 — Consecutive-triple Menger curvature

For three consecutive points `p0,p1,p2`, let their triangle have side lengths `a,b,c` and area `A`.

For three distinct non-collinear points,

\[
\kappa(p_0,p_1,p_2)
=
\frac{4A}{abc}
=
\frac{1}{R},
\]

where `R` is the circumradius.

For repeated-point or collinear triples, QSOL-GEO-REASON defines

\[
\kappa = 0.
\]

Equivalently, for consecutive displacements

\[
u=p_1-p_0,\qquad v=p_2-p_1
\]

and chord `c = ||p2-p0||`, when the triple is nondegenerate,

\[
\kappa
=
\frac{2\sin\theta}{c},
\]

where `theta` is the angle between `u` and `v`.

No absolute curvature threshold may replace a small nonzero curvature by zero.

## 7. Geometric transformation laws

### GEO-MATH-007 — Translation laws

For a fixed `t in R^d`, define

\[
(T_t Z)_i=z_i+t.
\]

Then:

- `Delta^0(T_t Z)` is generally not equal to `Delta^0 Z`;
- for every `k >= 1`, `Delta^k(T_t Z)=Delta^k Z`;
- `L(T_t Z)=L(Z)`;
- corresponding Menger curvatures are unchanged;
- any defined finite-difference cosine comparison at order `k >= 1` is unchanged when the same translation is applied.

This is the exact mathematical basis of the Phase 1 carrier/control translation analogues. It does not imply semantic equivalence in an LLM.

### GEO-MATH-008 — Euclidean isometry laws

Let

\[
F(x)=Qx+t
\]

where `Q` is orthogonal and `t` is a translation. Signed coordinate permutations used in Phase 1 are a restricted exact instance.

Then:

- displacement vectors transform as `Q Delta z`;
- path length is preserved;
- Menger curvature is preserved;
- cosine between corresponding nonzero displacement vectors is preserved;
- exact zero displacement remains exact zero.

### GEO-MATH-009 — Uniform scaling laws

For nonzero scalar `s`:

- `Delta^k(sZ)=s Delta^k Z`;
- `L(sZ)=|s|L(Z)`;
- corresponding cosine alignment is unchanged when both operands receive the same scaling;
- Menger curvature scales as `kappa(sZ)=kappa(Z)/|s|`.

This scale law is one reason the numerical implementation must not use fixed absolute thresholds to classify nonzero geometry as zero.

## 8. Domain and undefined cases

### GEO-MATH-010 — Undefined is not zero

An unavailable mathematical quantity must not be silently encoded as a valid zero.

In particular:

- mean cosine alignment is undefined when the selected finite-difference order leaves no samples;
- a dimension mismatch is invalid input;
- a requested exact-length alignment with different lengths is invalid input;
- non-finite implementation values are outside the Phase 1 binary64 conformance domain.

The implementation must reject these cases or represent them explicitly as unavailable.

## 9. Numerical representation boundary

### GEO-MATH-011 — Serialization normalization is not mathematics

The exact definitions above do not contain decimal rounding, binary64, JSON, SHA-256, or a numerical epsilon.

The Python reference implementation uses IEEE-754 binary64 arithmetic and normalizes finite output values to a fixed number of **significant decimal digits** before canonical serialization. This is a reproducibility convention only.

For trajectory coordinates, canonicalization is translation-aware: the implementation normalizes the first point and each point's displacement from the original first point, reconstructs the emitted absolute coordinates from that canonical origin plus canonical displacement, and then computes all emitted metrics and comparisons from those emitted coordinates. Therefore the machine-readable points and the machine-readable derived geometry refer to the same numerical trajectory.

Normalization must be scale-aware in the following minimal sense:

- it must not impose a fixed absolute floor that turns every sufficiently small nonzero value into zero;
- a representable local displacement must not be erased merely because the trajectory has a much larger absolute coordinate offset;
- exact negative zero may be canonicalized to positive zero;
- non-finite outputs are rejected.

The finite-precision Menger implementation may use exact dyadic-rational arithmetic on represented binary64 displacements to preserve exact collinearity and near-collinearity before converting a final finite curvature value back to binary64. This is an implementation-refinement device, not a replacement for `GEO-MATH-006`.

Hash identity is evidence provenance, not a mathematical invariant.

## 10. Phase 1 theorem targets

The following stable theorem targets are intended for a post-release Lean 4 formalization. Names are descriptive placeholders; the mathematical statements are the contract.

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-001 — Finite-difference length

For `0 <= k < n`, `Delta^k Z` has length `n-k`.

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-002 — Translation cancellation

For every `k >= 1`,

\[
\Delta^k(T_t Z)=\Delta^k Z.
\]

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-003 — Path-length translation invariance

\[
L(T_t Z)=L(Z).
\]

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-004 — Path-length isometry invariance

For orthogonal `Q`,

\[
L(QZ+t)=L(Z).
\]

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-005 — Zero-length characterization

\[
L(Z)=0
\]

iff all points of `Z` are equal.

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-006 — Cosine bounds

Whenever the extended cosine is defined by `GEO-MATH-004`,

\[
-1 \le C(u,v) \le 1.
\]

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-007 — Cosine isometry invariance

For orthogonal `Q`,

\[
C(Qu,Qv)=C(u,v).
\]

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-008 — Menger translation invariance

\[
\kappa(p_0+t,p_1+t,p_2+t)
=
\kappa(p_0,p_1,p_2).
\]

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-009 — Menger isometry invariance

For orthogonal `Q`,

\[
\kappa(Qp_0+t,Qp_1+t,Qp_2+t)
=
\kappa(p_0,p_1,p_2).
\]

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-010 — Menger scaling law

For `s != 0`,

\[
\kappa(sp_0,sp_1,sp_2)
=
\frac{1}{|s|}
\kappa(p_0,p_1,p_2).
\]

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-011 — Circle curvature

Three distinct non-collinear points on a Euclidean circle of radius `r > 0` have Menger curvature `1/r`.

### GEO-LEAN-TGT-012 — Arc-length endpoint preservation

For a nonzero-length piecewise-linear path, normalized arc-length parameterization evaluates to the original first point at progress `0` and the original last point at progress `1`.

## 11. Formalization boundary

The planned Lean development should formalize the exact layer using real Euclidean vector spaces, finite sequences, and explicit domain hypotheses.

It must not claim, without a separate verified refinement argument, to prove:

- CPython floating-point execution;
- `math.hypot`, `math.fsum`, or libm behavior;
- JSON canonicalization;
- SHA-256 implementation correctness;
- Git provenance checks;
- the deterministic noise generator;
- semantic or cognitive claims about LLM reasoning.

The intended evidence chain is therefore:

```text
MATH-SPEC exact definitions
        |
        +--> Lean 4 proofs of exact theorems
        |
        +--> Python conformance implementation
                  |
                  +--> GEO-SIM-001 frozen numerical fixtures
```

Agreement between those layers must be tested and documented rather than assumed.

## 12. Freeze policy

Changes to a `GEO-MATH-*` definition after the first immutable Phase 1 release are mathematical-contract changes.

Such a change should:

1. name every affected `GEO-MATH-*` and `GEO-LEAN-TGT-*` identifier;
2. state whether it is a clarification or a semantic change;
3. regenerate affected Python fixtures;
4. create a new release identity rather than rewriting frozen evidence;
5. update or reprove affected Lean theorems against the new release.

The first Lean formalization should target the exact immutable commit/tag produced after Phase 1 receives a green exact-head review and is merged.
